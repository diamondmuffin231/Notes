Psalm 16:7 

I have found that God speaks to me in the night seasons.

It used to be when I was younger that I could never remember when I younger 
that I could never remember when i laid down at night. Just slept straight through 
the alarm until morning. 

But as I'm getting older somehow I just don't sleep through like I used to.  
Now noises in the night can wake me up. 

...

I'd slept so soundly nothing would disturb my sleep but things have changed and 
now there are things that do disturb my sleep at night, and it used to be 
something would disturb me I could just roll right back over and go right 
back to sleep.

...

The phone rings at 3:00 in the morning and then I have diffuculty going back to
sleep after that and I just lie there and I just sort of toss because I've been
awakened out of a deep sleep

...

I used to get up upset at tossing, but no more. I find this is just glorious 
time to commune with the Lord. He instructs me in the night seasons, just to
open my heart to God and it's amazing the things that God pours into my heart
in the night hours. So I just now take it as an opportunity, rather than cursing
the sleeplessness at night, I just take it as a neat opportunity to be instructed 
of the Lord in the night seasons.
